# Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

The Advanced CI/CD Pipeline system is designed with a microservices architecture, enabling scalable, maintainable, and reliable continuous integration and deployment processes. The system is deployed across multiple cloud providers for high availability and disaster recovery.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Frontend Dashboard

The frontend dashboard is a React-based single-page application that provides real-time visualization of:
- Build and deployment status
- Test results and coverage
- System metrics and alerts
- Deployment history
- Performance analytics

**Key Technologies:**
- React 18
- TypeScript
- Material-UI
- Chart.js
- WebSocket for real-time updates

### 2. Backend Services

The backend is composed of several microservices:

#### API Gateway
- Handles authentication and authorization
- Routes requests to appropriate services
- Implements rate limiting and request validation
- Provides API documentation

#### Build Service
- Manages build pipelines
- Handles code compilation
- Generates artifacts
- Integrates with version control systems

#### Test Service
- Executes unit tests
- Runs integration tests
- Performs end-to-end testing
- Generates test reports

#### Deployment Service
- Manages deployment strategies
- Handles rollback procedures
- Coordinates multi-cloud deployments
- Implements zero-downtime deployments

#### Monitoring Service
- Collects system metrics
- Manages alerts
- Generates performance reports
- Integrates with monitoring tools

### 3. Infrastructure

#### Cloud Providers
- AWS (Primary)
- Azure (Secondary)
- Google Cloud (Tertiary)

#### Kubernetes Clusters
Each cloud provider hosts a Kubernetes cluster with:
- Node pools for different workloads
- Auto-scaling groups
- Load balancers
- Ingress controllers

#### Service Mesh
Istio service mesh provides:
- Traffic management
- Security
- Observability
- Load balancing

### 4. Data Storage

#### Primary Database
- PostgreSQL for application data
- Redis for caching
- MongoDB for metrics and logs

#### Object Storage
- S3-compatible storage for artifacts
- Container registry for Docker images
- Backup storage

### 5. Monitoring & Observability

#### Metrics Collection
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Custom dashboards
- Alert rules

#### Logging
- ELK Stack for log aggregation
- Log retention policies
- Log analysis tools

#### Tracing
- Jaeger for distributed tracing
- OpenTelemetry integration
- Performance profiling
